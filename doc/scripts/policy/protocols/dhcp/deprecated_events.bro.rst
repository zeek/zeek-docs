policy/protocols/dhcp/deprecated_events.bro
===========================================

Bro 2.6 removed certain DHCP events, but scripts in the Bro
ecosystem are still relying on those events. As a transition, this
script will handle the new event, and generate the old events,
which are marked as deprecated.  Note: This script should be
removed in the next Bro version after 2.6.

             dhcp_decline, dhcp_discover, dhcp_inform, dhcp_nak, dhcp_offer,
             dhcp_release and dhcp_request and is thus similarly deprecated
