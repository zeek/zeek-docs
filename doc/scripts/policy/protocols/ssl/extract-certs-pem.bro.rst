==========================================
.. bro:namespace:: SSL

This script is used to extract host certificates seen on the wire to disk
after being converted to PEM files.  The certificates will be stored in
a single file, one for local certificates and one for remote certificates.

.. note::

    - It doesn't work well on a cluster because each worker will write its
      own certificate files and no duplicate checking is done across the
      cluster so each node would log each certificate.
