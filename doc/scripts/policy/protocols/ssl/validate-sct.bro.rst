.. bro:type:: SSL::SctInfo

   :Type: :bro:type:`record`

      version: :bro:type:`count`
         The version of the encountered SCT (should always be 0 for v1).

      logid: :bro:type:`string`
         The ID of the log issuing this SCT.

      timestamp: :bro:type:`count`
         The timestamp at which this SCT was issued measured since the
         epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00), ignoring leap seconds, in
         milliseconds. Not converted to a Bro timestamp because we need
         the exact value for validation.

      sig_alg: :bro:type:`count`
         The signature algorithm used for this sct.

      hash_alg: :bro:type:`count`
         The hash algorithm used for this sct.

      signature: :bro:type:`string`
         The signature of this SCT.

      source: :bro:type:`SSL::SctSource`
         Source of this SCT.

      valid: :bro:type:`bool` :bro:attr:`&optional`
         Validation result of this SCT.

   This record is used to store information about the SCTs that are
   encountered in a SSL connection.

.. bro:type:: SSL::SctSource

   :Type: :bro:type:`enum`

      .. bro:enum:: SSL::SCT_X509_EXT SSL::SctSource

         Signed Certificate Timestamp was encountered in the extension of
         an X.509 certificate.

      .. bro:enum:: SSL::SCT_TLS_EXT SSL::SctSource

         Signed Certificate Timestamp was encountered in an TLS session
         extension.

      .. bro:enum:: SSL::SCT_OCSP_EXT SSL::SctSource

         Signed Certificate Timestamp was encountered in the extension of
         an stapled OCSP reply.
