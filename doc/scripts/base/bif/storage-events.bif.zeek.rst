   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (tag: :zeek:type:`string`, options: :zeek:type:`any`, reason: :zeek:type:`string`)

   it, and is not generated automatically by the storage framework.
   

   :param tag: A string describing the backend that enqueued this event. This is typically
        generated by the ``Tag()`` method in the backend plugin.
   

   :param options: A copy of the configuration options passed to
            :zeek:see:`Storage::Async::open_backend` or
            :zeek:see:`Storage::Sync::open_backend` when the backend was initially opened.
   

   :param reason: A string describing why the connection was lost.
