.. zeek:id:: sct_verify

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (cert: :zeek:type:`opaque` of x509, logid: :zeek:type:`string`, log_key: :zeek:type:`string`, signature: :zeek:type:`string`, timestamp: :zeek:type:`count`, hash_algorithm: :zeek:type:`count`, issuer_key_hash: :zeek:type:`string` :zeek:attr:`&default` = ``""`` :zeek:attr:`&optional`) : :zeek:type:`bool`

   Verifies a Signed Certificate Timestamp as used for Certificate Transparency.
   See RFC6962 for more details.
   

   :cert: Certificate against which the SCT should be validated.
   

   :logid: Log id of the SCT.
   

   :log_key: Public key of the Log that issued the SCT proof.
   

   :timestamp: Timestamp at which the proof was generated.
   

   :hash_algorithm: Hash algorithm that was used for the SCT proof.
   

   :issuer_key_hash: The SHA-256 hash of the certificate issuer's public key.
                    This only has to be provided if the SCT was encountered in an X.509
                    certificate extension; in that case, it is necessary for validation.
   

   :returns: T if the validation could be performed succesfully, F otherwhise.
