      been ported to Bro 2.x. To still enable this event, one needs to
      register a port for it or add a DPD payload signature.

.. bro:id:: pm_request_unset

   :Type: :bro:type:`event` (r: :bro:type:`connection`, m: :bro:type:`pm_mapping`, success: :bro:type:`bool`)

   Generated for Portmapper request/reply dialogues of type *unset*.
   
   Portmapper is a service running on top of RPC. See `Wikipedia
   <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmap>`__ for more information about the
   service.
   

   :r: The RPC connection.
   

   :m: The argument to the request.
   

   :success: True if the request was successful, according to the corresponding
            reply. If no reply was seen, this will be false once the request
            times out.

   Generated for RPC *call* messages.
   
   See `Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ONC_RPC>`__ for more information
   about the ONC RPC protocol.
   

   :c: The connection.
   

   :xid: The transaction identifier allowing to match requests with replies.
   

   :prog: The remote program to call.
   

   :ver: The version of the remote program to call.
   

   :proc: The procedure of the remote program to call.

   Generated for RPC request/reply *pairs*. The RPC analyzer associates request
   and reply by their transaction identifiers and raises this event once both
   have been seen. If there's not a reply, this event will still be generated
   eventually on timeout. In that case, *status* will be set to
   :bro:enum:`RPC_TIMEOUT`.

   :ver: The version of the remote program to call.
   

   :proc: The procedure of the remote program to call.
   

   :status: The status of the reply, which should be one of the index values of
           :bro:id:`RPC_status`.
   

   :start_time: The time when the *call* was seen.
   

   :call_len: The size of the *call_body* PDU.
