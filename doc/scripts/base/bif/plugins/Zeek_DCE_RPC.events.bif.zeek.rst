.. zeek:id:: dce_rpc_alter_context

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (c: :zeek:type:`connection`, fid: :zeek:type:`count`, ctx_id: :zeek:type:`count`, uuid: :zeek:type:`string`, ver_major: :zeek:type:`count`, ver_minor: :zeek:type:`count`)

   Generated for every :abbr:`DCE-RPC (Distributed Computing Environment/Remote Procedure Calls)` alter context request message.
   Since RPC offers the ability for a client to request connections to multiple endpoints, this event can occur
   multiple times for a single RPC message.
   

   :c: The connection.
   

   :fid: File ID of the PIPE that carried the :abbr:`DCE-RPC (Distributed Computing Environment/Remote Procedure Calls)`
        message. Zero will be used if the :abbr:`DCE-RPC (Distributed Computing Environment/Remote Procedure Calls)` was
        not transported over a pipe.
   

   :ctx_id: The context identifier of the data representation.
   

   :uuid: The string interpretted uuid of the endpoint being requested.
   

   :ver_major: The major version of the endpoint being requested.
   

   :ver_minor: The minor version of the endpoint being requested.

        message. Zero will be used if the :abbr:`DCE-RPC (Distributed Computing Environment/Remote Procedure Calls)` was
        not transported over a pipe.

   Generated for every :abbr:`DCE-RPC (Distributed Computing Environment/Remote Procedure Calls)` bind request ack message.
   

   :c: The connection.
   

   :fid: File ID of the PIPE that carried the :abbr:`DCE-RPC (Distributed Computing Environment/Remote Procedure Calls)`
