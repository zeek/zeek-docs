.. bro:id:: activating_encryption

   :Type: :bro:type:`event` (c: :bro:type:`connection`)

   Generated for Telnet sessions when encryption is activated. The Telnet
   protocol includes options for negotiating encryption. When such a series of
   options is successfully negotiated, the event engine generates this event.
   
   See `Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet>`__ for more information
   about the Telnet protocol.
   

   :c: The connection.
   
   .. bro:see:: authentication_accepted authentication_rejected authentication_skipped
      login_confused login_confused_text login_display login_failure login_input_line
      login_output_line login_prompt login_success login_terminal

.. bro:id:: authentication_accepted

   :Type: :bro:type:`event` (name: :bro:type:`string`, c: :bro:type:`connection`)

   Generated when a Telnet authentication has been successful. The Telnet
   protocol includes options for negotiating authentication. When such an
   option is sent from client to server and the server replies that it accepts
   the authentication, then the event engine generates this event.
   
   See `Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet>`__ for more information
   about the Telnet protocol.
   

   :name: The authenticated name.
   

   :c: The connection.
   
   .. bro:see::  authentication_rejected authentication_skipped login_success
   
   .. note::  This event inspects the corresponding Telnet option
      while :bro:id:`login_success` heuristically determines success by watching
      session data.
   
   .. todo:: Bro's current default configuration does not activate the protocol
      analyzer that generates this event; the corresponding script has not yet
      been ported to Bro 2.x. To still enable this event, one needs to add a
      call to :bro:see:`Analyzer::register_for_ports` or a DPD payload
      signature.

.. bro:id:: authentication_rejected

   :Type: :bro:type:`event` (name: :bro:type:`string`, c: :bro:type:`connection`)

   Generated when a Telnet authentication has been unsuccessful. The Telnet
   protocol includes options for negotiating authentication. When such an option
   is sent from client to server and the server replies that it did not accept
   the authentication, then the event engine generates this event.
   
   See `Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet>`__ for more information
   about the Telnet protocol.
   

   :name: The attempted authentication name.
   

   :c: The connection.
   
   .. bro:see:: authentication_accepted authentication_skipped login_failure
   
   .. note::  This event inspects the corresponding Telnet option
      while :bro:id:`login_success` heuristically determines failure by watching
      session data.
   
   .. todo:: Bro's current default configuration does not activate the protocol
      analyzer that generates this event; the corresponding script has not yet
      been ported to Bro 2.x. To still enable this event, one needs to add a
      call to :bro:see:`Analyzer::register_for_ports` or a DPD payload
      signature.

.. bro:id:: authentication_skipped

   :Type: :bro:type:`event` (c: :bro:type:`connection`)

   Generated for Telnet/Rlogin sessions when a pattern match indicates
   that no authentication is performed.
   
   See `Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet>`__ for more information
   about the Telnet protocol.
   

   :c: The connection.
   
   .. bro:see:: authentication_accepted authentication_rejected direct_login_prompts
      get_login_state login_failure_msgs login_non_failure_msgs login_prompts
      login_success_msgs login_timeouts set_login_state
   
   .. note:: The login analyzer depends on a set of script-level variables that
      need to be configured with patterns identifying activity. This
      configuration has not yet been ported over from Bro 1.5 to Bro 2.x, and
      the analyzer is therefore not directly usable at the moment.
   
   .. todo:: Bro's current default configuration does not activate the protocol
      analyzer that generates this event; the corresponding script has not yet
      been ported to Bro 2.x. To still enable this event, one needs to add a
      call to :bro:see:`Analyzer::register_for_ports` or a DPD payload
      signature.

.. bro:id:: bad_option

   :Type: :bro:type:`event` (c: :bro:type:`connection`)

   Generated for an ill-formed or unrecognized Telnet option.
   
   See `Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet>`__ for more information
   about the Telnet protocol.
   

   :c: The connection.
   
   .. bro:see:: inconsistent_option bad_option_termination authentication_accepted
      authentication_rejected authentication_skipped login_confused
      login_confused_text login_display login_failure login_input_line

      analyzer that generates this event; the corresponding script has not yet
      been ported to Bro 2.x. To still enable this event, one needs to add a
      call to :bro:see:`Analyzer::register_for_ports` or a DPD payload
      signature.

.. bro:id:: bad_option_termination

   :Type: :bro:type:`event` (c: :bro:type:`connection`)

   Generated for a Telnet option that's incorrectly terminated.
   
   See `Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet>`__ for more information
   about the Telnet protocol.
   

   :c: The connection.
   
   .. bro:see:: inconsistent_option bad_option authentication_accepted
      authentication_rejected authentication_skipped login_confused
      login_confused_text login_display login_failure login_input_line

   .. todo:: Bro's current default configuration does not activate the protocol
      analyzer that generates this event; the corresponding script has not yet
      been ported to Bro 2.x. To still enable this event, one needs to add a
      call to :bro:see:`Analyzer::register_for_ports` or a DPD payload
      signature.

.. bro:id:: inconsistent_option

   :Type: :bro:type:`event` (c: :bro:type:`connection`)

   Generated for an inconsistent Telnet option. Telnet options are specified
   by the client and server stating which options they are willing to
   support vs. which they are not, and then instructing one another which in
   fact they should or should not use for the current connection. If the event
   engine sees a peer violate either what the other peer has instructed it to
   do, or what it itself offered in terms of options in the past, then the
   engine generates this event.
   
   See `Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet>`__ for more information
   about the Telnet protocol.
   

   :c: The connection.
   
   .. bro:see:: bad_option bad_option_termination  authentication_accepted

.. bro:id:: login_confused

   :Type: :bro:type:`event` (c: :bro:type:`connection`, msg: :bro:type:`string`, line: :bro:type:`string`)

   Generated when tracking of Telnet/Rlogin authentication failed. As Bro's
   *login* analyzer uses a number of heuristics to extract authentication
   information, it may become confused. If it can no longer correctly track
   the authentication dialog, it raises this event.
   

   :c: The connection.
   

   :msg: Gives the particular problem the heuristics detected (for example,
        ``multiple_login_prompts`` means that the engine saw several login
        prompts in a row, without the type-ahead from the client side presumed
        necessary to cause them)
   

   :line: The line of text that caused the heuristics to conclude they were
         confused.

   .. todo:: Bro's current default configuration does not activate the protocol
      analyzer that generates this event; the corresponding script has not yet
      been ported to Bro 2.x. To still enable this event, one needs to add a

      signature.

.. bro:id:: login_confused_text

   :Type: :bro:type:`event` (c: :bro:type:`connection`, line: :bro:type:`string`)

   Generated after getting confused while tracking a Telnet/Rlogin
   authentication dialog. The *login* analyzer generates this even for every
   line of user input after it has reported :bro:id:`login_confused` for a
   connection.
   

   :c: The connection.
   

   :line: The line the user typed.

      signature.

.. bro:id:: login_display

   :Type: :bro:type:`event` (c: :bro:type:`connection`, display: :bro:type:`string`)

   Generated for clients transmitting an X11 DISPLAY in a Telnet session. This
   information is extracted out of environment variables sent as Telnet options.
   

   :c: The connection.
   

   :display: The DISPLAY transmitted.

   :Type: :bro:type:`event` (c: :bro:type:`connection`, user: :bro:type:`string`, client_user: :bro:type:`string`, password: :bro:type:`string`, line: :bro:type:`string`)

   Generated for Telnet/Rlogin login failures. The *login* analyzer inspects
   Telnet/Rlogin sessions to heuristically extract username and password
   information as well as the text returned by the login server. This event is
   raised if a login attempt appears to have been unsuccessful.
   

   :c: The connection.
   

   :user: The user name tried.
   

   :client_user: For Telnet connections, this is an empty string, but for Rlogin
         connections, it is the client name passed in the initial authentication
         information (to check against .rhosts).
