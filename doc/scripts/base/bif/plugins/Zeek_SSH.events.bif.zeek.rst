.. zeek:id:: ssh1_server_host_key

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (c: :zeek:type:`connection`, p: :zeek:type:`string`, e: :zeek:type:`string`)

   During the :abbr:`SSH (Secure Shell)` key exchange, the server
   supplies its public host key. This event is generated when the
   appropriate key exchange message is seen for SSH1.
   

   :c: The connection over which the :abbr:`SSH (Secure Shell)`
      connection took place.
   

   :p: The prime for the server's public host key.
   

   :e: The exponent for the serer's public host key.

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (c: :zeek:type:`connection`, p: :zeek:type:`string`, q: :zeek:type:`string`)

   Generated if the connection uses a Diffie-Hellman Group Exchange
   key exchange method. This event contains the server DH parameters,
   which are sent in the SSH_MSG_KEY_DH_GEX_GROUP message as defined in
   :rfc:`4419#section-3`.
   

   :c: The connection.
   

   :p: The DH prime modulus.
   

   :q: The DH generator.

.. zeek:id:: ssh2_ecc_key

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (c: :zeek:type:`connection`, is_orig: :zeek:type:`bool`, q: :zeek:type:`string`)

   The :abbr:`ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman)` and
   :abbr:`ECMQV (Elliptic Curve Menezes-Qu-Vanstone)` key exchange
   algorithms use two ephemeral key pairs to generate a shared
   secret. This event is generated when either the client's or
   server's ephemeral public key is seen. For more information, see:
   :rfc:`5656#section-4`.
   

   :c: The connection
   

   :is_orig: Did this message come from the originator?
   

   :q: The ephemeral public key

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (c: :zeek:type:`connection`, major_status: :zeek:type:`count`, minor_status: :zeek:type:`count`, err_msg: :zeek:type:`string`)

   In the event of a GSS-API error on the server, the server MAY send
   send an error message with some additional details. This event is
   generated when such an error message is seen. For more information,
   see :rfc:`4462#section-2.1`.
   

   :c: The connection.
   

   :major_status: GSS-API major status code.

.. zeek:id:: ssh2_server_host_key

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (c: :zeek:type:`connection`, key: :zeek:type:`string`)

   During the :abbr:`SSH (Secure Shell)` key exchange, the server
   supplies its public host key. This event is generated when the
   appropriate key exchange message is seen for SSH2.
   

   :c: The connection over which the :abbr:`SSH (Secure Shell)`
      connection took place.
   

   :key: The server's public host key. Note that this is the public key
      itself, and not just the fingerprint or hash.

.. zeek:id:: ssh_auth_attempted

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (c: :zeek:type:`connection`, authenticated: :zeek:type:`bool`)

   This event is generated when an :abbr:`SSH (Secure Shell)`
   connection was determined to have had an authentication attempt.
   This determination is based on packet size analysis, and errs
   on the side of caution - that is, if there's any doubt about
   whether or not an authenication attempt occured, this event is
   *not* raised.
   
   At this point in the protocol, all we can determine is whether
   or not the user is authenticated. We don't know if the particular
   attempt succeeded or failed, since some servers require multiple
   authentications (e.g. require both a password AND a pubkey), and
   could return an authentication failed message which is marked
   as a partial success.
   
   This event will often be raised multiple times per connection.
   In almost all connections, it will be raised once unless
   

   :c: The connection over which the :abbr:`SSH (Secure Shell)`
      connection took place.
   

   :authenticated: This is true if the analyzer detected a
      successful connection from the authentication attempt.

.. zeek:id:: ssh_auth_successful

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (c: :zeek:type:`connection`, auth_method_none: :zeek:type:`bool`)

   This event is generated when an :abbr:`SSH (Secure Shell)`
   connection was determined to have had a successful
   authentication. This determination is based on packet size
   analysis, and errs on the side of caution - that is, if there's any
   doubt about the authentication success, this event is *not* raised.
   

   :c: The connection over which the :abbr:`SSH (Secure Shell)`
      connection took place.
   

   :auth_method_none: This is true if the analyzer detected a
      successful connection before any authentication challenge. The
      :abbr:`SSH (Secure Shell)` protocol provides a mechanism for
      unauthenticated access, which some servers support.

.. zeek:id:: ssh_capabilities

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (c: :zeek:type:`connection`, cookie: :zeek:type:`string`, capabilities: :zeek:type:`SSH::Capabilities`)

   During the initial :abbr:`SSH (Secure Shell)` key exchange, each
   endpoint lists the algorithms that it supports, in order of
   preference. This event is generated for each endpoint, when the
   SSH_MSG_KEXINIT message is seen. See :rfc:`4253#section-7.1` for
   details.
   

   :c: The connection over which the :abbr:`SSH (Secure Shell)`
      connection took place.
   

   :cookie: The SSH_MSG_KEXINIT cookie - a random value generated by
      the sender.
   

   :capabilities: The list of algorithms and languages that the sender
      advertises support for, in order of preference.

.. zeek:id:: ssh_client_version

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (c: :zeek:type:`connection`, version: :zeek:type:`string`)

   An :abbr:`SSH (Secure Shell)` Protocol Version Exchange message
   from the client. This contains an identification string that's used
   for version identification. See :rfc:`4253#section-4.2` for
   details.
   

   :c: The connection over which the message was sent.

.. zeek:id:: ssh_encrypted_packet

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (c: :zeek:type:`connection`, orig: :zeek:type:`bool`, len: :zeek:type:`count`)

   This event is generated when an :abbr:`SSH (Secure Shell)`
   encrypted packet is seen. This event is not handled by default, but
   is provided for heuristic analysis scripts. Note that you have to set
   :zeek:id:`SSH::disable_analyzer_after_detection` to false to use this
   event. This carries a performance penalty.
   

   :c: The connection over which the :abbr:`SSH (Secure Shell)`
      connection took place.
   

   :orig: Whether the packet was sent by the originator of the TCP
      connection.
   

   :len: The length of the :abbr:`SSH (Secure Shell)` payload, in
      bytes. Note that this ignores reassembly, as this is unknown.

.. zeek:id:: ssh_server_version

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (c: :zeek:type:`connection`, version: :zeek:type:`string`)

   An :abbr:`SSH (Secure Shell)` Protocol Version Exchange message
   from the server. This contains an identification string that's used
   for version identification. See :rfc:`4253#section-4.2` for
   details.
