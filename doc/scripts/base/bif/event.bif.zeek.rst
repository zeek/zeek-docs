=======================
.. zeek:namespace:: GLOBAL

The protocol-independent events that the C/C++ core of Zeek can generate.

This is mostly events not related to a specific transport- or
application-layer protocol, but also includes a few that may be generated
by more than one protocols analyzer (like events generated by both UDP and
TCP analysis.)

Events
######
.. zeek:id:: anonymization_mapping

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (orig: :zeek:type:`addr`, mapped: :zeek:type:`addr`)

   Shows an IP address anonymization mapping.

.. zeek:id:: bro_done

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` ()
   :Attributes: :zeek:attr:`&deprecated` = ``"Remove in v3.1: use zeek_done"``

   Deprecated synonym for :zeek:see:`zeek_done`.

.. zeek:id:: bro_init

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` ()
   :Attributes: :zeek:attr:`&deprecated` = ``"Remove in v3.1: use zeek_init"``

   Deprecated synonym for :zeek:see:`zeek_init`.

.. zeek:id:: bro_script_loaded

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (path: :zeek:type:`string`, level: :zeek:type:`count`)
   :Attributes: :zeek:attr:`&deprecated` = *"Remove in v3.1: use zeek_script_loaded"*

   Deprecated synonym for :zeek:see:`zeek_script_loaded`.

.. zeek:id:: conn_stats

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (c: :zeek:type:`connection`, os: :zeek:type:`endpoint_stats`, rs: :zeek:type:`endpoint_stats`)

   Generated when a TCP connection terminated, passing on statistics about the
   two endpoints. This event is always generated when Zeek flushes the internal
   connection state, independent of how a connection terminates.
   

   :c: The connection.
   

   :os: Statistics for the originator endpoint.
   

   :rs: Statistics for the responder endpoint.
   
   .. zeek:see:: connection_state_remove

.. zeek:id:: conn_weird

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (name: :zeek:type:`string`, c: :zeek:type:`connection`, addl: :zeek:type:`string`)

   Generated for unexpected activity related to a specific connection.  When
   Zeek's packet analysis encounters activity that does not conform to a
   protocol's specification, it raises one of the ``*_weird`` events to report
   that. This event is raised if the activity is tied directly to a specific
   connection.
   

   :name: A unique name for the specific type of "weird" situation. Zeek's default
         scripts use this name in filtering policies that specify which
         "weirds" are worth reporting.
   

   :c: The corresponding connection.
   

   :addl: Optional additional context further describing the situation.
   
   .. zeek:see:: flow_weird net_weird file_weird
   
   .. note:: "Weird" activity is much more common in real-world network traffic
      than one would intuitively expect. While in principle, any protocol
      violation could be an attack attempt, it's much more likely that an
      endpoint's implementation interprets an RFC quite liberally.

.. zeek:id:: connection_external

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (c: :zeek:type:`connection`, tag: :zeek:type:`string`)

   Generated for a new connection received from the communication subsystem.
   Remote peers can inject packets into Zeek's packet loop, for example via
   Broccoli.  The communication system
   raises this event with the first packet of a connection coming in this way.
   

   :c: The connection.
   

   :tag: TODO.

.. zeek:id:: connection_flow_label_changed

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (c: :zeek:type:`connection`, is_orig: :zeek:type:`bool`, old_label: :zeek:type:`count`, new_label: :zeek:type:`count`)

   Generated for a connection over IPv6 when one direction has changed
   the flow label that it's using.
   

   :c: The connection.
   

   :is_orig: True if the event is raised for the originator side.
   

   :old_label: The old flow label that the endpoint was using.
   

   :new_label: The new flow label that the endpoint is using.
   
   .. zeek:see:: connection_established new_connection

.. zeek:id:: connection_reused

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (c: :zeek:type:`connection`)

   Generated when a connection 4-tuple is reused. This event is raised when Zeek
   sees a new TCP session or UDP flow using a 4-tuple matching that of an
   earlier connection it still considers active.
   

   :c: The connection.
   
   .. zeek:see:: connection_EOF connection_SYN_packet connection_attempt
      connection_established connection_external connection_finished
      connection_first_ACK connection_half_finished connection_partial_close

.. zeek:id:: connection_state_remove

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (c: :zeek:type:`connection`)

   Generated when a connection's internal state is about to be removed from
   memory. Zeek generates this event reliably once for every connection when it
   is about to delete the internal state. As such, the event is well-suited for
   script-level cleanup that needs to be performed for every connection.  This
   event is generated not only for TCP sessions but also for UDP and ICMP
   flows.
   

   :c: The connection.

.. zeek:id:: connection_status_update

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (c: :zeek:type:`connection`)

   Generated in regular intervals during the lifetime of a connection. The
   event is raised each ``connection_status_update_interval`` seconds
   and can be used to check conditions on a regular basis.
   

   :c: The connection.

.. zeek:id:: connection_timeout

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (c: :zeek:type:`connection`)

   Generated when a TCP connection timed out. This event is raised when
   no activity was seen for an interval of at least
   :zeek:id:`tcp_connection_linger`, and either one endpoint has already
   closed the connection or one side never became active.
   

   :c: The connection.

   .. note::
   
      The precise semantics of this event can be unintuitive as it only
      covers a subset of cases where a connection times out. Often, handling
      :zeek:id:`connection_state_remove` is the better option. That one will be
      generated reliably when an interval of ``tcp_inactivity_timeout`` has
      passed without any activity seen (but also for all other ways a
      connection may terminate).

.. zeek:id:: content_gap

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (c: :zeek:type:`connection`, is_orig: :zeek:type:`bool`, seq: :zeek:type:`count`, length: :zeek:type:`count`)

   Generated when Zeek detects a gap in a reassembled TCP payload stream. This
   event is raised when Zeek, while reassembling a payload stream, determines
   that a chunk of payload is missing (e.g., because the responder has already
   acknowledged it, even though Zeek didn't see it).
   

   :c: The connection.
   

   :is_orig: True if the gap is on the originator's side.
   

   :seq: The sequence number where the gap starts.
   

   :length: The number of bytes missing.
   
   .. note::
   
      Content gaps tend to occur occasionally for various reasons, including
      broken TCP stacks. If, however, one finds lots of them, that typically
      means that there is a problem with the monitoring infrastructure such as
      a tap dropping packets, split routing on the path, or reordering at the
      tap.

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (dm: :zeek:type:`dns_mapping`, old_addrs: :zeek:type:`addr_set`, new_addrs: :zeek:type:`addr_set`)

   Generated when an internal DNS lookup produced a different result than in
   the past.  Zeek keeps an internal DNS cache for host names and IP addresses
   it has already resolved. This event is generated when a subsequent lookup
   returns a different answer than we have stored in the cache.
   

   :dm: A record describing the new resolver result.
   

   :old_addrs: Addresses that used to be part of the returned set for the query
              described by *dm*, but are not anymore.

   Generated when an internal DNS lookup returned zero answers even though it
   had succeeded in the past. Zeek keeps an internal DNS cache for host names
   and IP addresses it has already resolved. This event is generated when
   on a subsequent lookup we receive an answer that is empty even

   Generated when an internal DNS lookup succeeded but an earlier attempt
   did not. Zeek keeps an internal DNS cache for host names and IP
   addresses it has already resolved. This event is generated when a subsequent
   lookup produces an answer for a query that was marked as failed in the cache.

   Generated each time Zeek's script interpreter opens a file. This event is
   triggered only for files opened via :zeek:id:`open`, and in particular not for
   normal log files as created by log writers.
   

   :f: The opened file.

.. zeek:id:: file_over_new_connection

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (f: :zeek:type:`fa_file`, c: :zeek:type:`connection`, is_orig: :zeek:type:`bool`)

   Indicates that the file had an overflow of the reassembly buffer.
   This is a specialization of the :zeek:id:`file_gap` event.
   

   :f: The file.
   

   :offset: The byte offset from the start of the file at which the reassembly
           couldn't continue due to running out of reassembly buffer space.
   

   :skipped: The number of bytes of the file skipped over to flush some
            file data and get back under the reassembly buffer size limit.

   Provide all metadata that has been inferred about a particular file
   from inspection of the initial content that been seen at the beginning
   of the file.  The analysis can be augmented at this time via
   :zeek:see:`Files::add_analyzer`.  The amount of data fed into the file
   sniffing can be increased or decreased by changing either
   :zeek:see:`default_file_bof_buffer_size` or the `bof_buffer_size` field
   in an `fa_file` record. The event will be raised even if content inspection
   has been unable to infer any metadata, in which case the fields in *meta*
   will be left all unset.

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (name: :zeek:type:`string`, f: :zeek:type:`fa_file`, addl: :zeek:type:`string`)

   Generated for unexpected activity that is tied to a file.
   When Zeek's packet analysis encounters activity that
   does not conform to a protocol's specification, it raises one of the
   ``*_weird`` events to report that.
   

   :name: A unique name for the specific type of "weird" situation. Zeek's default
         scripts use this name in filtering policies that specify which
         "weirds" are worth reporting.
   

   :f: The corresponding file.

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (name: :zeek:type:`string`, src: :zeek:type:`addr`, dst: :zeek:type:`addr`, addl: :zeek:type:`string`)

   Generated for unexpected activity related to a pair of hosts, but independent
   of a specific connection.  When Zeek's packet analysis encounters activity
   that does not conform to a protocol's specification, it raises one of
   the ``*_weird`` events to report that. This event is raised if the activity
   is related to a pair of hosts, yet not to a specific connection between
   them.

.. zeek:id:: get_file_handle

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (tag: :zeek:type:`Analyzer::Tag`, c: :zeek:type:`connection`, is_orig: :zeek:type:`bool`)

   This event is handled to provide feedback to the file analysis framework
   about how to identify the logical "file" to which some data/input
   belongs.  All incoming data to the framework is buffered, and depends
   on a handler for this event to return a string value that uniquely
   identifies a file.  Among all handlers of this event, the last one to
   call :zeek:see:`set_file_handle` will "win".
   

   :tag: The analyzer which is carrying the file data.
   

   :c: The connection which is carrying the file data.
   

   :is_orig: The direction the file data is flowing over the connection.

.. zeek:id:: ipv6_ext_headers

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (c: :zeek:type:`connection`, p: :zeek:type:`pkt_hdr`)

   This is potentially an expensive event to handle if analysing IPv6 traffic
   that happens to utilize extension headers frequently.

.. zeek:id:: load_sample

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (samples: :zeek:type:`load_sample_info`, CPU: :zeek:type:`interval`, dmem: :zeek:type:`int`)

   Generated regularly for the purpose of profiling Zeek's processing. This event
   is raised for every :zeek:id:`load_sample_freq` packet. For these packets,
   Zeek records script-level functions executed during their processing as well
   as further internal locations. By sampling the processing in this form, one
   can understand where Zeek spends its time.
   

   :samples: A set with functions and locations seen during the processing of
            the sampled packet.
   

   :CPU: The CPU time spent on processing the sampled packet.
   

   :dmem: The difference in memory usage caused by processing the sampled packet.

.. zeek:id:: mobile_ipv6_message

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (p: :zeek:type:`pkt_hdr`)

   Generated for any packet using a Mobile IPv6 Mobility Header.

.. zeek:id:: net_weird

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (name: :zeek:type:`string`, addl: :zeek:type:`string`)

   Generated for unexpected activity that is not tied to a specific connection
   or pair of hosts. When Zeek's packet analysis encounters activity that
   does not conform to a protocol's specification, it raises one of the
   ``*_weird`` events to report that. This event is raised if the activity is
   not tied directly to a specific connection or pair of hosts.
   

   :name: A unique name for the specific type of "weird" situation. Zeek's default
         scripts use this name in filtering policies that specify which
         "weirds" are worth reporting.
   

   :addl: Optional additional context further describing the situation.

.. zeek:id:: new_connection

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (c: :zeek:type:`connection`)

   Generated for every new connection. This event is raised with the first
   packet of a previously unknown connection. Zeek uses a flow-based definition
   of "connection" here that includes not only TCP sessions but also UDP and
   ICMP flows.
   

   :c: The connection.

   .. note::
   
      Handling this event is potentially expensive. For example, during a SYN

      event.

.. zeek:id:: new_event

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (name: :zeek:type:`string`, params: :zeek:type:`call_argument_vector`)

   A meta event generated for events that Zeek raises. This will report all
   events for which at least one handler is defined.
   
   Note that handling this meta event is expensive and should be limited to
   debugging purposes.
   

   :name: The name of the event.
   

   :params: The event's parameters.

.. zeek:id:: new_packet

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (c: :zeek:type:`connection`, p: :zeek:type:`pkt_hdr`)

   Generated for all packets that make it into Zeek's connection processing. In
   contrast to :zeek:id:`raw_packet` this filters out some more packets that don't
   pass certain sanity checks.
   
   This is a very low-level and expensive event that should be avoided when at all
   possible. It's usually infeasible to handle when processing even medium volumes
   of traffic in real-time. That said, if you work from a trace and want to do some
   packet-level analysis, it may come in handy.

.. zeek:id:: protocol_confirmation

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (c: :zeek:type:`connection`, atype: :zeek:type:`Analyzer::Tag`, aid: :zeek:type:`count`)

   Generated when a protocol analyzer confirms that a connection is indeed
   using that protocol. Zeek's dynamic protocol detection heuristically activates
   analyzers as soon as it believes a connection *could* be using a particular
   protocol. It is then left to the corresponding analyzer to verify whether
   that is indeed the case; if so, this event will be generated.
   

   :c: The connection.
   

   :atype: The type of the analyzer confirming that its protocol is in
          use. The value is one of the ``Analyzer::ANALYZER_*`` constants. For example,
          ``Analyzer::ANALYZER_HTTP`` means the HTTP analyzer determined that it's indeed
          parsing an HTTP connection.
   

   :aid:   A unique integer ID identifying the specific *instance* of the
          analyzer *atype*  that is analyzing the connection ``c``. The ID can
          be used to reference the analyzer when using builtin functions like

   .. zeek:see:: protocol_violation
   
   .. note::
   
      Zeek's default scripts use this event to determine the ``service`` column

      Zeek's default scripts use this event to disable an analyzer via

      engine.

   :Attributes: :zeek:attr:`&error_handler`

   Raised for errors reported via Zeek's reporter framework. Such messages may
   be generated internally by the event engine and also by other scripts calling
   :zeek:id:`Reporter::error`.
   

   :t: The time the error was passed to the reporter.
   

   :msg: The error message.
   

   :location: A (potentially empty) string describing a location associated with
       the error.

      will go to ``stderr`` instead.

   scripts calling :zeek:id:`Reporter::info`.
   

   :t: The time the message was passed to the reporter.
   

   :msg: The message itself.
   

   :location: A (potentially empty) string describing a location associated with
             the message.

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (t: :zeek:type:`time`, msg: :zeek:type:`string`, location: :zeek:type:`string`)

   Raised for warnings reported via Zeek's reporter framework. Such messages may
   be generated internally by the event engine and also by other scripts calling
   :zeek:id:`Reporter::warning`.
   

   :t: The time the warning was passed to the reporter.

   :location: A (potentially empty) string describing a location associated with
       the warning.

.. zeek:id:: rexmit_inconsistency

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (c: :zeek:type:`connection`, t1: :zeek:type:`string`, t2: :zeek:type:`string`, tcp_flags: :zeek:type:`string`)

   Generated when Zeek detects a TCP retransmission inconsistency. When
   reassembling a TCP stream, Zeek buffers all payload until it sees the
   responder acking it. If during that time, the sender resends a chunk of
   payload but with different content than originally, this event will be
   raised. In addition, if :zeek:id:`tcp_max_old_segments` is larger than zero,
   mismatches with that older still-buffered data will likewise trigger the event.
   

   :c: The connection showing the inconsistency.
   

   :t1: The original payload.
   

   :t2: The new payload.
   

   :tcp_flags: A string with the TCP flags of the packet triggering the
              inconsistency. In the string, each character corresponds to one
              set flag, as follows: ``S`` -> SYN; ``F`` -> FIN; ``R`` -> RST;
              ``A`` -> ACK; ``P`` -> PUSH. This string will not always be set,
              only if the information is available; it's "best effort".

.. zeek:id:: scheduled_analyzer_applied

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (c: :zeek:type:`connection`, a: :zeek:type:`Analyzer::Tag`)

   Generated when a connection is seen that is marked as being expected.
   The function :zeek:id:`Analyzer::schedule_analyzer` tells Zeek to expect a
   particular connection to come up, and which analyzer to associate with it.
   Once the first packet of such a connection is indeed seen, this event is
   raised.
   

   :c: The connection.
   

   :a: The analyzer that was scheduled for the connection with the
      :zeek:id:`Analyzer::schedule_analyzer` call. When the event is raised, that
      analyzer will already have been activated to process the connection. The
      ``count`` is one of the ``ANALYZER_*`` constants, e.g., ``ANALYZER_HTTP``.

   .. todo:: We don't have a good way to document the automatically generated
      ``ANALYZER_*`` constants right now.

.. zeek:id:: signature_match

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (state: :zeek:type:`signature_state`, msg: :zeek:type:`string`, data: :zeek:type:`string`)

   Generated when a signature matches. Zeek's signature engine provides
   high-performance pattern matching separately from the normal script
   processing. If a signature with an ``event`` action matches, this event is
   raised.
   
   See the :doc:`user manual </frameworks/signatures>` for more information
   about Zeek's signature engine.
   

   :state: Context about the match, including which signatures triggered the
          event and the connection for which the match was found.
   

   :msg: The message passed to the ``event`` signature action.
   

   :data: The last chunk of input that triggered the match. Note that the
         specifics here are not well-defined as Zeek does not buffer any input.
         If a match is split across packet boundaries, only the last chunk
         triggering the match will be passed on to the event.

.. zeek:id:: tunnel_changed

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (c: :zeek:type:`connection`, e: :zeek:type:`EncapsulatingConnVector`)

   Generated for a connection whose tunneling has changed.  This could
   be from a previously seen connection now being encapsulated in a tunnel,
   or from the outer encapsulation changing.  Note that connection *c*'s
   *tunnel* field is NOT automatically/internally assigned to the new
   encapsulation value of *e* after this event is raised.  If the desired
   behavior is to track the latest tunnel encapsulation per-connection,
   then a handler of this event should assign *e* to ``c$tunnel`` (which Zeek's
   default scripts are doing).
   

   :c: The connection whose tunnel/encapsulation changed.
   

   :e: The new encapsulation.

.. zeek:id:: udp_session_done

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (u: :zeek:type:`connection`)

   Generated when a UDP session for a supported protocol has finished. Some of
   Zeek's application-layer UDP analyzers flag the end of a session by raising
   this event. Currently, the analyzers for DNS, NTP, Netbios, Syslog, AYIYA,
   Teredo, and GTPv1 support this.
   

   :u: The connection record for the corresponding UDP flow.
   
   .. zeek:see:: udp_contents udp_reply udp_request

.. zeek:id:: zeek_done

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` ()

   Generated at Zeek termination time. The event engine generates this event when
   Zeek is about to terminate, either due to having exhausted reading its input
   trace file(s), receiving a termination signal, or because Zeek was run without
   a network input source and has finished executing any global statements.
   
   .. zeek:see:: zeek_init
   
   .. note::
   
      If Zeek terminates due to an invocation of :zeek:id:`exit`, then this event
      is not generated.

.. zeek:id:: zeek_init

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` ()

   Generated at Zeek initialization time. The event engine generates this
   event just before normal input processing begins. It can be used to execute
   one-time initialization code at startup. At the time a handler runs, Zeek will
   have executed any global initializations and statements.
   
   .. zeek:see:: zeek_done
   
   .. note::
   
      When a ``zeek_init`` handler executes, Zeek has not yet seen any input
      packets and therefore :zeek:id:`network_time` is not initialized yet. An
      artifact of that is that any timer installed in a ``zeek_init`` handler
      will fire immediately with the first packet. The standard way to work
      around that is to ignore the first time the timer fires and immediately
      reschedule.
   

.. zeek:id:: zeek_script_loaded

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (path: :zeek:type:`string`, level: :zeek:type:`count`)

   Raised for each policy script loaded by the script interpreter.
   

   :path: The full path to the script loaded.
   

   :level: The "nesting level": zero for a top-level Zeek script and incremented
          recursively for each ``@load``.
