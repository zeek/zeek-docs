Functions
#########
.. zeek:id:: clean

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (str: :zeek:type:`string`) : :zeek:type:`string`

   Replaces non-printable characters in a string with escaped sequences. The
   mappings are:
   
       - values not in *[32, 126]* to ``\xXX``
   
   If the string does not yet have a trailing NUL, one is added internally.
   
   In contrast to :zeek:id:`escape_string`, this encoding is *not* fully reversible.`
   

   :str: The string to escape.
   

   :returns: The escaped string.
   
   .. zeek:see:: to_string_literal escape_string

.. zeek:id:: edit

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (arg_s: :zeek:type:`string`, arg_edit_char: :zeek:type:`string`) : :zeek:type:`string`

   Returns an edited version of a string that applies a special
   "backspace character" (usually ``\x08`` for backspace or ``\x7f`` for DEL).
   For example, ``edit("hello there", "e")`` returns ``"llo t"``.
   

   :arg_s: The string to edit.
   

   :arg_edit_char: A string of exactly one character that represents the
                  "backspace character". If it is longer than one character Zeek
                  generates a run-time error and uses the first character in
                  the string.
   

   :returns: An edited version of *arg_s* where *arg_edit_char* triggers the
            deletion of the last character.
   
   .. zeek:see:: clean

.. zeek:id:: escape_string

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (s: :zeek:type:`string`) : :zeek:type:`string`

   Replaces non-printable characters in a string with escaped sequences. The
   mappings are:
   
       - values not in *[32, 126]* to ``\xXX``
       - ``\`` to ``\\``
   
   In contrast to :zeek:id:`clean`, this encoding is fully reversible.`

   :returns: The escaped string.

.. zeek:id:: find_last

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (str: :zeek:type:`string`, re: :zeek:type:`pattern`) : :zeek:type:`string`

   Finds the last occurrence of a pattern in a string. This function returns
   the match that starts at the largest index in the string, which is not
   necessarily the longest match.  For example, a pattern of ``/.*/`` will
   return the final character in the string.
   

   :str: The string to inspect.
   

   :re: The pattern to look for in *str*.
   

   :returns: The last string in *str* that matches *re*, or the empty string.

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (str: :zeek:type:`string`, re: :zeek:type:`pattern`, repl: :zeek:type:`string`) : :zeek:type:`string`

   Substitutes a given replacement string for all occurrences of a pattern
   in a given string.
   

   :str: The string to perform the substitution in.
   

   :re: The pattern being replaced with *repl*.

   starting at the beginning of the string until first mismatch.
   

   :str: The string to strip characters from.

   :zeek:id:`system` or similar calls.
   

   :source: The string to escape.
   

   :returns: A shell-escaped version of *source*.  Specifically, this
            backslash-escapes characters whose literal value is not otherwise
            preserved by enclosure in double-quotes (dollar-sign, backquote,
            backslash, and double-quote itself), and then encloses that
            backslash-escaped string in double-quotes to ultimately preserve
            the literal value of all input characters.
   
   .. zeek:see:: system safe_shell_quote

   :str: The string to split.

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (str: :zeek:type:`string`, re: :zeek:type:`pattern`) : :zeek:type:`string_vec`

   Splits a string *once* into a two-element array of strings according to a
   pattern. This function is the same as :zeek:id:`split_string`, but *str* is
   only split once (if possible) at the earliest position and an array of two
   strings is returned.
   

   :str: The string to split.
   

   :re: The pattern describing the separator to split *str* in two pieces.
   

   :returns: An array of strings with two elements in which the first represents
            the substring in *str* up to the first occurence of *re*, and the
            second everything after *re*. An array of one string is returned
            when *s* cannot be split.
   
   .. zeek:see:: split_string split_string_all split_string_n str_split

.. zeek:id:: split_string_all

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (str: :zeek:type:`string`, re: :zeek:type:`pattern`) : :zeek:type:`string_vec`

   Splits a string into an array of strings according to a pattern. This
   function is the same as :zeek:id:`split_string`, except that the separators
   are returned as well. For example, ``split_string_all("a-b--cd", /(\-)+/)``
   returns ``{"a", "-", "b", "--", "cd"}``: odd-indexed elements do match the
   pattern and even-indexed ones do not.
   

   :str: The string to split.
   

   :re: The pattern describing the element separator in *str*.
   

   :returns: An array of strings where each two successive elements correspond
            to a substring in *str* of the part not matching *re* (even-indexed)
            and the part that matches *re* (odd-indexed).
   
   .. zeek:see:: split_string split_string1 split_string_n str_split

.. zeek:id:: split_string_n

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (str: :zeek:type:`string`, re: :zeek:type:`pattern`, incl_sep: :zeek:type:`bool`, max_num_sep: :zeek:type:`count`) : :zeek:type:`string_vec`

   Splits a string a given number of times into an array of strings according
   to a pattern. This function is similar to :zeek:id:`split_string1` and
   :zeek:id:`split_string_all`, but with customizable behavior with respect to
   including separators in the result and the number of times to split.
   

   :str: The string to split.
   

   :re: The pattern describing the element separator in *str*.
   

   :incl_sep: A flag indicating whether to include the separator matches in the
             result (as in :zeek:id:`split_string_all`).
   

   :max_num_sep: The number of times to split *str*.
   

   :returns: An array of strings where, if *incl_sep* is true, each two
            successive elements correspond to a substring in *str* of the part
            not matching *re* (even-indexed) and the part that matches *re*
            (odd-indexed).
   
   .. zeek:see:: split_string split_string1 split_string_all str_split

.. zeek:id:: str_shell_escape

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (source: :zeek:type:`string`) : :zeek:type:`string`
   :Attributes: :zeek:attr:`&deprecated` = *"Remove in v3.1: use safe_shell_quote"*

   Takes a string and escapes characters that would allow execution of
   commands at the shell level. Must be used before including strings in
   :zeek:id:`system` or similar calls.  This function is deprecated, use
   :zeek:see:`safe_shell_quote` as a replacement.  The difference is that
   :zeek:see:`safe_shell_quote` automatically returns a value that is
   wrapped in double-quotes, which is required to correctly and fully
   escape any characters that might be interpreted by the shell.
   

   :source: The string to escape.
   

   :returns: A shell-escaped version of *source*.
   
   .. zeek:see:: system safe_shell_quote

.. zeek:id:: str_smith_waterman

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (s1: :zeek:type:`string`, s2: :zeek:type:`string`, params: :zeek:type:`sw_params`) : :zeek:type:`sw_substring_vec`

   Uses the Smith-Waterman algorithm to find similar/overlapping substrings.
   See `Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith%E2%80%93Waterman_algorithm>`__.
   

   :s1: The first string.
   

   :s2: The second string.
   

   :params: Parameters for the Smith-Waterman algorithm.
