.. zeek:namespace:: Cluster

A framework for establishing and controlling a cluster of Zeek instances.
In order to use the cluster framework, a script named
``cluster-layout.zeek`` must exist somewhere in Zeek's script search path
which has a cluster definition of the :zeek:id:`Cluster::nodes` variable.
The ``CLUSTER_NODE`` environment variable or :zeek:id:`Cluster::node`
must also be sent and the cluster framework loaded as a package like
``@load base/frameworks/cluster``.

   named cluster-layout.zeek somewhere in the ZEEKPATH.  It will be
   automatically loaded if the CLUSTER_NODE environment variable is set.
   Note that ZeekControl handles all of this automatically.
   The table is typically indexed by node names/labels (e.g. "manager"

Events
######
.. zeek:id:: Cluster::hello

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (name: :zeek:type:`string`, id: :zeek:type:`string`)

   When using broker-enabled cluster framework, nodes broadcast this event
   to exchange their user-defined name along with a string that uniquely
   identifies it for the duration of its lifetime.  This string may change
   if the node dies and has to reconnect later.

.. zeek:id:: Cluster::node_down

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (name: :zeek:type:`string`, id: :zeek:type:`string`)

   When using broker-enabled cluster framework, this event will be emitted
   locally whenever a connected cluster node becomes disconnected.

.. zeek:id:: Cluster::node_up

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (name: :zeek:type:`string`, id: :zeek:type:`string`)

   When using broker-enabled cluster framework, this event will be emitted
   locally whenever a cluster node connects or reconnects.

Functions
#########
.. zeek:id:: Cluster::create_store

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (name: :zeek:type:`string`, persistent: :zeek:type:`bool` :zeek:attr:`&default` = ``F`` :zeek:attr:`&optional`) : :zeek:type:`Cluster::StoreInfo`

   Sets up a cluster-enabled data store.  They will also still properly
   function for uses that are not operating a cluster.
   

   :name: the name of the data store to create.
   

   :persistent: whether the data store must be persistent.
   

   :returns: the store's information.  For master stores, the store will be
            ready to use immediately.  For clones, the store field will not
            be set until the node containing the master store has connected.

.. zeek:id:: Cluster::is_enabled

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` () : :zeek:type:`bool`

   This function can be called at any time to determine if the cluster
   framework is being enabled for this run.
   

   :returns: True if :zeek:id:`Cluster::node` has been set.

.. zeek:id:: Cluster::local_node_type

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` () : :zeek:type:`Cluster::NodeType`

   This function can be called at any time to determine what type of
   cluster node the current Zeek instance is going to be acting as.
   If :zeek:id:`Cluster::is_enabled` returns false, then
   :zeek:enum:`Cluster::NONE` is returned.
   

   :returns: The :zeek:type:`Cluster::NodeType` the calling node acts as.

.. zeek:id:: Cluster::log

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (msg: :zeek:type:`string`) : :zeek:type:`void`

   Write a message to the cluster logging stream.

.. zeek:id:: Cluster::node_topic

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (name: :zeek:type:`string`) : :zeek:type:`string`

   Retrieve the topic associated with a specific node in the cluster.
   

   :name: the name of the cluster node (e.g. "manager").
   

   :returns: a topic string that may used to send a message exclusively to
            a given cluster node.

.. zeek:id:: Cluster::nodeid_topic

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (id: :zeek:type:`string`) : :zeek:type:`string`

   Retrieve the topic associated with a specific node in the cluster.
   

   :id: the id of the cluster node (from :zeek:see:`Broker::EndpointInfo`
       or :zeek:see:`Broker::node_id`.
   

   :returns: a topic string that may used to send a message exclusively to
            a given cluster node.
