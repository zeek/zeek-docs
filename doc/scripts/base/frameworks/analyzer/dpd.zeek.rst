   :Type: :zeek:type:`count`

   Ignore violations which go this many bytes into the connection.
   Set to 0 to never ignore protocol violations.

   :Type: :zeek:type:`bool`
   :Attributes: :zeek:attr:`&redef`
   :Default: ``F``

   Change behavior of service field in conn.log:
   Failed services are no longer removed. Instead, for a failed
   service, a second entry with a "-" in front of it is added.
   E.g. a http connection with a violation would be logged as
   "http,-http".
