=================================
.. bro:namespace:: Reporter

This framework is intended to create an output and filtering path for
internal messages/warnings/errors.  It should typically be loaded to
log such messages to a file in a standard way.  For the options to
toggle whether messages are additionally written to STDERR, see
:bro:see:`Reporter::info_to_stderr`,
:bro:see:`Reporter::warnings_to_stderr`, and
:bro:see:`Reporter::errors_to_stderr`.

Note that this framework deals with the handling of internally generated
reporter messages, for the interface
into actually creating reporter messages from the scripting layer, use
the built-in functions in :doc:`/scripts/base/bif/reporter.bif.bro`.
