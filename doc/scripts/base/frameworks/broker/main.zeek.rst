   :Default: ``T``

   Whether calling :zeek:see:`Broker::peer` will register the Broker
   system as an I/O source that will block the process from shutting
   down.  For example, set this to false when you are reading pcaps,
   but also want to initaiate a Broker peering and still shutdown after
   done reading the pcap.

   :Default: ``F``

   If true, do not use SSL for network connections. By default, SSL will
   even be used if no certificates / CAs have been configured. In that case
   (which is the default) the communication will be encrypted, but not
   authenticated.

   :Attributes: :zeek:attr:`&redef`
   :Default: ``"sharing"``

   The CAF scheduling policy to use.  Available options are "sharing" and
   "stealing".  The "sharing" policy uses a single, global work queue along
   with mutex and condition variable used for accessing it, which may be
   better for cases that don't require much concurrency or need lower power
   consumption.  The "stealing" policy uses multiple work queues protected
   by spinlocks, which may be better for use-cases that have more
   concurrency needs.  E.g. may be worth testing the "stealing" policy
   along with dedicating more threads if a lot of data store processing is
   required.

Functions
#########
.. zeek:id:: Broker::auto_publish

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (topic: :zeek:type:`string`, ev: :zeek:type:`any`) : :zeek:type:`bool`

   Automatically send an event to any interested peers whenever it is
   locally dispatched. (For example, using "event my_event(...);" in a
   script.)
   

   :topic: a topic string associated with the event message.
          Peers advertise interest by registering a subscription to some
          prefix of this topic name.
   

   :ev: a Zeek event value.
   

   :returns: true if automatic event sending is now enabled.

.. zeek:id:: Broker::auto_unpublish

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (topic: :zeek:type:`string`, ev: :zeek:type:`any`) : :zeek:type:`bool`

   Stop automatically sending an event to peers upon local dispatch.
   

   :topic: a topic originally given to :zeek:see:`Broker::auto_publish`.
   

   :ev: an event originally given to :zeek:see:`Broker::auto_publish`.
   

   :returns: true if automatic events will not occur for the topic/event
            pair.

.. zeek:id:: Broker::default_log_topic

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (id: :zeek:type:`Log::ID`, path: :zeek:type:`string`) : :zeek:type:`string`

   The default implementation for :zeek:see:`Broker::log_topic`.

.. zeek:id:: Broker::flush_logs

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` () : :zeek:type:`count`

   Sends all pending log messages to remote peers.  This normally
   doesn't need to be used except for test cases that are time-sensitive.

.. zeek:id:: Broker::forward

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (topic_prefix: :zeek:type:`string`) : :zeek:type:`bool`

   Register a topic prefix subscription for events that should only be
   forwarded to any subscribing peers and not raise any event handlers
   on the receiving/forwarding node.  i.e. it's the same as
   :zeek:see:`Broker::subscribe` except matching events are not raised
   on the receiver, just forwarded.  Use :zeek:see:`Broker::unsubscribe`
   with the same argument to undo this operation.
   

   :topic_prefix: a prefix to match against remote message topics.
                 e.g. an empty prefix matches everything and "a" matches
                 "alice" and "amy" but not "bob".
   

   :returns: true if a new event forwarding/subscription is now registered.

.. zeek:id:: Broker::listen

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (a: :zeek:type:`string` :zeek:attr:`&default` = :zeek:see:`Broker::default_listen_address` :zeek:attr:`&optional`, p: :zeek:type:`port` :zeek:attr:`&default` = :zeek:see:`Broker::default_port` :zeek:attr:`&optional`, retry: :zeek:type:`interval` :zeek:attr:`&default` = :zeek:see:`Broker::default_listen_retry` :zeek:attr:`&optional`) : :zeek:type:`port`

   Listen for remote connections.
   

   :a: an address string on which to accept connections, e.g.
      "127.0.0.1".  An empty string refers to INADDR_ANY.
   

   :p: the TCP port to listen on. The value 0 means that the OS should choose
      the next available free port.
   

   :retry: If non-zero, retries listening in regular intervals if the port cannot be
          acquired immediately. 0 disables retries.  If the
          ZEEK_DEFAULT_LISTEN_RETRY environment variable is set (as number
          of seconds), it overrides any value given here.
   

   :returns: the bound port or 0/? on failure.
   
   .. zeek:see:: Broker::status

.. zeek:id:: Broker::log_topic

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (id: :zeek:type:`Log::ID`, path: :zeek:type:`string`) : :zeek:type:`string`
   :Attributes: :zeek:attr:`&redef`

   A function that will be called for each log entry to determine what
   broker topic string will be used for sending it to peers.  The
   default implementation will return a value based on
   :zeek:see:`Broker::default_log_topic_prefix`.
   

   :id: the ID associated with the log stream entry that will be sent.
   

   :path: the path to which the log stream entry will be output.
   

   :returns: a string representing the broker topic to which the log
            will be sent.

.. zeek:id:: Broker::node_id

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` () : :zeek:type:`string`

   Get a unique identifier for the local broker endpoint.
   

   :returns: a unique identifier for the local broker endpoint.

.. zeek:id:: Broker::peer

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (a: :zeek:type:`string`, p: :zeek:type:`port` :zeek:attr:`&default` = :zeek:see:`Broker::default_port` :zeek:attr:`&optional`, retry: :zeek:type:`interval` :zeek:attr:`&default` = :zeek:see:`Broker::default_connect_retry` :zeek:attr:`&optional`) : :zeek:type:`bool`

   Initiate a remote connection.
   

   :a: an address to connect to, e.g. "localhost" or "127.0.0.1".
   

   :p: the TCP port on which the remote side is listening.
   

   :retry: an interval at which to retry establishing the
          connection with the remote peer if it cannot be made initially, or
          if it ever becomes disconnected.  If the
          ZEEK_DEFAULT_CONNECT_RETRY environment variable is set (as number
          of seconds), it overrides any value given here.
   

   :returns: true if it's possible to try connecting with the peer and
            it's a new peer. The actual connection may not be established
            until a later point in time.
   
   .. zeek:see:: Broker::status

.. zeek:id:: Broker::peers

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` () : :zeek:type:`vector` of :zeek:type:`Broker::PeerInfo`

   Get a list of all peer connections.
   

   :returns: a list of all peer connections.

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (topic: :zeek:type:`string`, id: :zeek:type:`string`) : :zeek:type:`bool`

   Publishes the value of an identifier to a given topic.  The subscribers
   will update their local value for that identifier on receipt.
   

   :topic: a topic associated with the message.
   

   :id: the identifier to publish.
   

   :returns: true if the message is sent.

.. zeek:id:: Broker::subscribe

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (topic_prefix: :zeek:type:`string`) : :zeek:type:`bool`

   Register interest in all peer event messages that use a certain topic
   prefix.  Note that subscriptions may not be altered immediately after
   calling (except during :zeek:see:`zeek_init`).
   

   :topic_prefix: a prefix to match against remote message topics.
                 e.g. an empty prefix matches everything and "a" matches
                 "alice" and "amy" but not "bob".
   

   :returns: true if it's a new event subscription and it is now registered.

.. zeek:id:: Broker::unpeer

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (a: :zeek:type:`string`, p: :zeek:type:`port`) : :zeek:type:`bool`

   Remove a remote connection.
   
   Note that this does not terminate the connection to the peer, it
   just means that we won't exchange any further information with it
   unless peering resumes later.
   

   :a: the address used in previous successful call to :zeek:see:`Broker::peer`.
   

   :p: the port used in previous successful call to :zeek:see:`Broker::peer`.
   

   :returns: true if the arguments match a previously successful call to
            :zeek:see:`Broker::peer`.
   

   :TODO: We do not have a function yet to terminate a connection.

.. zeek:id:: Broker::unsubscribe

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (topic_prefix: :zeek:type:`string`) : :zeek:type:`bool`

   Unregister interest in all peer event messages that use a topic prefix.
   Note that subscriptions may not be altered immediately after calling
   (except during :zeek:see:`zeek_init`).
   

   :topic_prefix: a prefix previously supplied to a successful call to
                 :zeek:see:`Broker::subscribe` or :zeek:see:`Broker::forward`.
   

   :returns: true if interest in the topic prefix is no longer advertised.
