State Variables
###############
.. zeek:id:: Log::active_streams

   :Type: :zeek:type:`table` [:zeek:type:`Log::ID`] of :zeek:type:`Log::Stream`
   :Default: ``{}``

   The streams which are currently active and not disabled.
   This table is not meant to be modified by users!  Only use it for
   examining which streams are active.

Types
#####
.. zeek:type:: Log::Filter

   :Type: :zeek:type:`record`

      name: :zeek:type:`string`
         Descriptive name to reference this filter.

      writer: :zeek:type:`Log::Writer` :zeek:attr:`&default` = :zeek:see:`Log::default_writer` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         The logging writer implementation to use.

      pred: :zeek:type:`function` (rec: :zeek:type:`any`) : :zeek:type:`bool` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         Indicates whether a log entry should be recorded.
         If not given, all entries are recorded.
         

         :rec: An instance of the stream's ``columns`` type with its
              fields set to the values to be logged.
         

         :returns: True if the entry is to be recorded.

      path: :zeek:type:`string` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         Output path for recording entries matching this
         filter.
         
         The specific interpretation of the string is up to the
         logging writer, and may for example be the destination
         file name. Generally, filenames are expected to be given
         without any extensions; writers will add appropriate
         extensions automatically.
         
         If this path is found to conflict with another filter's
         for the same writer type, it is automatically corrected
         by appending "-N", where N is the smallest integer greater
         or equal to 2 that allows the corrected path name to not
         conflict with another filter's.

      path_func: :zeek:type:`function` (id: :zeek:type:`Log::ID`, path: :zeek:type:`string`, rec: :zeek:type:`any`) : :zeek:type:`string` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         A function returning the output path for recording entries
         matching this filter. This is similar to *path* yet allows
         to compute the string dynamically. It is ok to return
         different strings for separate calls, but be careful: it's
         easy to flood the disk by returning a new string for each
         connection.  Upon adding a filter to a stream, if neither
         ``path`` nor ``path_func`` is explicitly set by them, then
         :zeek:see:`Log::default_path_func` is used.
         

         :id: The ID associated with the log stream.
         

         :path: A suggested path value, which may be either the filter's
               ``path`` if defined, else a previous result from the
               function.  If no ``path`` is defined for the filter,
               then the first call to the function will contain an
               empty string.
         

         :rec: An instance of the stream's ``columns`` type with its
              fields set to the values to be logged.
         

         :returns: The path to be used for the filter, which will be
                  subject to the same automatic correction rules as
                  the *path* field of :zeek:type:`Log::Filter` in the
                  case of conflicts with other filters trying to use
                  the same writer/path pair.

      include: :zeek:type:`set` [:zeek:type:`string`] :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         Subset of column names to record. If not given, all
         columns are recorded.

      exclude: :zeek:type:`set` [:zeek:type:`string`] :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         Subset of column names to exclude from recording. If not
         given, all columns are recorded.

      log_local: :zeek:type:`bool` :zeek:attr:`&default` = :zeek:see:`Log::enable_local_logging` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         If true, entries are recorded locally.

      log_remote: :zeek:type:`bool` :zeek:attr:`&default` = :zeek:see:`Log::enable_remote_logging` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         If true, entries are passed on to remote peers.

      field_name_map: :zeek:type:`table` [:zeek:type:`string`] of :zeek:type:`string` :zeek:attr:`&default` = :zeek:see:`Log::default_field_name_map` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         Field name map to rename fields before the fields are written
         to the output.

      scope_sep: :zeek:type:`string` :zeek:attr:`&default` = :zeek:see:`Log::default_scope_sep` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         A string that is used for unrolling and flattening field names
         for nested record types.

      ext_prefix: :zeek:type:`string` :zeek:attr:`&default` = :zeek:see:`Log::default_ext_prefix` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         Default prefix for all extension fields. It's typically
         prudent to set this to something that Zeek's logging
         framework can't normally write out in a field name.

      ext_func: :zeek:type:`function` (path: :zeek:type:`string`) : :zeek:type:`any` :zeek:attr:`&default` = :zeek:see:`Log::default_ext_func` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         Function to collect a log extension value.  If not specified,
         no log extension will be provided for the log.
         The return value from the function *must* be a record.

      interv: :zeek:type:`interval` :zeek:attr:`&default` = :zeek:see:`Log::default_rotation_interval` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         Rotation interval. Zero disables rotation.

      postprocessor: :zeek:type:`function` (info: :zeek:type:`Log::RotationInfo`) : :zeek:type:`bool` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         Callback function to trigger for rotated files. If not set, the
         default comes out of :zeek:id:`Log::default_rotation_postprocessors`.

      config: :zeek:type:`table` [:zeek:type:`string`] of :zeek:type:`string` :zeek:attr:`&default` = ``{  }`` :zeek:attr:`&optional`
         A key/value table that will be passed on to the writer.
         Interpretation of the values is left to the writer, but
         usually they will be used for configuration purposes.

   A filter type describes how to customize logging streams.

      .. zeek:enum:: Notice::LOG Log::ID

         (present if :doc:`/scripts/base/frameworks/notice/main.zeek` is loaded)

   set as "default" to a given logging stream.
   

   :id: The ID associated with a logging stream for which to add a default
       filter.
   

   :returns: The status of a call to :zeek:id:`Log::add_filter` using a
            default :zeek:type:`Log::Filter` argument with ``name`` field
            set to "default".
   
   .. zeek:see:: Log::add_filter Log::remove_filter

.. zeek:id:: Log::add_filter

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (id: :zeek:type:`Log::ID`, filter: :zeek:type:`Log::Filter`) : :zeek:type:`bool`

   Adds a custom filter to an existing logging stream.  If a filter
   with a matching ``name`` field already exists for the stream, it
   is removed when the new filter is successfully added.
   

   :id: The ID associated with the logging stream to filter.
   

   :filter: A record describing the desired logging parameters.
   

   :returns: True if the filter was successfully added, false if
            the filter was not added or the *filter* argument was not
            the correct type.
   
   .. zeek:see:: Log::remove_filter Log::add_default_filter

.. zeek:id:: Log::create_stream

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (id: :zeek:type:`Log::ID`, stream: :zeek:type:`Log::Stream`) : :zeek:type:`bool`

   Creates a new logging stream with the default filter.
   

   :id: The ID enum to be associated with the new logging stream.
   

   :stream: A record defining the content that the new stream will log.
   

   :returns: True if a new logging stream was successfully created and
            a default filter added to it.
   
   .. zeek:see:: Log::add_default_filter Log::remove_default_filter

.. zeek:id:: Log::default_ext_func

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (path: :zeek:type:`string`) : :zeek:type:`any`
   :Attributes: :zeek:attr:`&redef`

   Default log extension function in the case that you would like to
   apply the same extensions to all logs.  The function *must* return
   a record with all of the fields to be included in the log. The
   default function included here does not return a value, which indicates
   that no extensions are added.

.. zeek:id:: Log::default_path_func

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (id: :zeek:type:`Log::ID`, path: :zeek:type:`string`, rec: :zeek:type:`any`) : :zeek:type:`string`
   :Attributes: :zeek:attr:`&redef`

   Builds the default path values for log filters if not otherwise
   specified by a filter. The default implementation uses *id*
   to derive a name.  Upon adding a filter to a stream, if neither
   ``path`` nor ``path_func`` is explicitly set by them, then
   this function is used as the ``path_func``.
   

   :id: The ID associated with the log stream.
   

   :path: A suggested path value, which may be either the filter's
         ``path`` if defined, else a previous result from the function.
         If no ``path`` is defined for the filter, then the first call
         to the function will contain an empty string.
   

   :rec: An instance of the stream's ``columns`` type with its
        fields set to the values to be logged.
   

   :returns: The path to be used for the filter.
