==================
Zeek Documentation
==================

.. note::

    The Zeek codebase has three primary branches of interest to users and
    this document is also maintained as three different versions, one
    associated with each branch of Zeek.  The default version of
    `docs.zeek.org <https://docs.zeek.org>`_ tracks the latest Zeek release:

      * Current Feature Release: https://docs.zeek.org/en/current

    If you instead use a Zeek Long-Term Support (LTS) release or
    Git *master* branch, these are the appropriate starting points:

      * Long-Term Support Release: https://docs.zeek.org/en/lts
      * Git *master* Branch: https://docs.zeek.org/en/master

    To help clarify which release you are using, the version numbering
    scheme for the two release branches is described in the `Release
    Cadence <https://github.com/zeek/zeek/wiki/Release-Cadence>`_ policy.
