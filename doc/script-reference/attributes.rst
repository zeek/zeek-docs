Here is a more detailed explanation of each attribute:

.. zeek:attr:: &redef

    Allows use of a :zeek:keyword:`redef` to redefine initial values of
    global variables (i.e., variables declared either :zeek:keyword:`global`
    or :zeek:keyword:`const`).  Example::

        const clever = T &redef;
        global cache_size = 256 &redef;

    Note that a variable declared "global" can also have its value changed
    with assignment statements (doesn't matter if it has the "&redef"
    attribute or not).

.. zeek:attr:: &priority

    Specifies the execution priority (as a signed integer) of a hook or
    event handler. Higher values are executed before lower ones. The
    default value is 0.  Example::

        event zeek_init() &priority=10
        {
            print "high priority";
        }

.. zeek:attr:: &log

    Writes a :zeek:type:`record` field to the associated log stream.

.. zeek:attr:: &optional

    Allows a record field value to be missing (i.e., neither initialized nor
    ever assigned a value).

    In this example, the record could be instantiated with either
    "myrec($a=127.0.0.1)" or "myrec($a=127.0.0.1, $b=80/tcp)"::

        type myrec: record { a: addr; b: port &optional; };

    The ``?$`` operator can be used to check if a record field has a value or
    not (it returns a ``bool`` value of ``T`` if the field has a value,
    and ``F`` if not).

.. zeek:attr:: &default

    Specifies a default value for a record field, container element, or a
    function/hook/event parameter.

    In this example, the record could be instantiated with either
    "myrec($a=5, $c=3.14)" or "myrec($a=5, $b=53/udp, $c=3.14)"::

        type myrec: record { a: count; b: port &default=80/tcp; c: double; };

    In this example, the table will return the string ``"foo"`` for any
    attempted access to a non-existing index::

        global mytable: table[count] of string &default="foo";

    When used with function/hook/event parameters, all of the parameters
    with the "&default" attribute must come after all other parameters.
    For example, the following function could be called either as "myfunc(5)"
    or as "myfunc(5, 53/udp)"::

        function myfunc(a: count, b: port &default=80/tcp)
        {
            print a, b;
        }

.. zeek:attr:: &add_func

    Can be applied to an identifier with &redef to specify a function to
    be called any time a "redef <id> += ..." declaration is parsed.  The
    function takes two arguments of the same type as the identifier, the first
    being the old value of the variable and the second being the new
    value given after the "+=" operator in the "redef" declaration.  The
    return value of the function will be the actual new value of the
    variable after the "redef" declaration is parsed.

.. zeek:attr:: &delete_func

    Same as :zeek:attr:`&add_func`, except for :zeek:keyword:`redef` declarations
    that use the "-=" operator.

.. zeek:attr:: &expire_func

    Called right before a container element expires. The function's first
    argument is of the same type as the container it is associated with.
    The function then takes a variable number of arguments equal to the
    number of indexes in the container. For example, for a
    ``table[string,string] of count`` the expire function signature is:

    .. sourcecode:: zeek

        function(t: table[string, string] of count, s: string, s2: string): interval

    The return value is an :zeek:type:`interval` indicating the amount of
    additional time to wait before expiring the container element at the
    given index (which will trigger another execution of this function).

.. zeek:attr:: &read_expire

    Specifies a read expiration timeout for container elements. That is,
    the element expires after the given amount of time since the last
    time it has been read. Note that a write also counts as a read.

.. zeek:attr:: &write_expire

    Specifies a write expiration timeout for container elements. That
    is, the element expires after the given amount of time since the
    last time it has been written.

.. zeek:attr:: &create_expire

    Specifies a creation expiration timeout for container elements. That
    is, the element expires after the given amount of time since it has
    been inserted into the container, regardless of any reads or writes.

.. zeek:attr:: &raw_output

    Opens a file in raw mode, i.e., non-ASCII characters are not
    escaped.

.. zeek:attr:: &error_handler

    Internally set on the events that are associated with the reporter
    framework: :zeek:id:`reporter_info`, :zeek:id:`reporter_warning`, and
    :zeek:id:`reporter_error`.  It prevents any handlers of those events
    from being able to generate reporter messages that go through any of
    those events (i.e., it prevents an infinite event recursion).  Instead,
    such nested reporter messages are output to stderr.

.. zeek:attr:: &type_column

    Used by the input framework. It can be used on columns of type
    :zeek:type:`port` (such a column only contains the port number) and
    specifies the name of an additional column in
    the input file which specifies the protocol of the port (tcp/udp/icmp).

    In the following example, the input file would contain four columns
    named "ip", "srcp", "proto", and "msg"::

        type Idx: record {
            ip: addr;
        };


        type Val: record {
            srcp: port &type_column = "proto";
            msg: string;
        };

.. zeek:attr:: &deprecated

    The associated identifier is marked as deprecated and will be
    removed in a future version of Zeek.  Look in the NEWS file for more
    instructions to migrate code that uses deprecated functionality.
    This attribute can be assigned an optional string literal value to
    print along with the deprecation warning. The preferred format of
    this warning message should include the version number in which
    the identifier will be removed::

        type warned: string &deprecated="This type is deprecated. Removed in x.y.z.";
