   The Broker communication framework facilitates connecting to remote Bro
   instances to share state and transfer events.

:doc:`base/frameworks/input </scripts/base/frameworks/input/index>`

   The file analysis framework provides an interface for driving the analysis
   of files, possibly independent of any network protocol over which they're
   transported.

:doc:`base/frameworks/files/magic </scripts/base/frameworks/files/magic/index>`


:doc:`base/bif </scripts/base/bif/index>`


:doc:`base/bif/plugins </scripts/base/bif/plugins/index>`

   This framework is intended to create an output and filtering path for
   internally generated messages/warnings/errors.

:doc:`base/frameworks/notice </scripts/base/frameworks/notice/index>`

   The notice framework enables Bro to "notice" things which are odd or
   potentially bad, leaving it to the local configuration to define which
   of them are actionable.  This decoupling of detection and reporting allows
   Bro to be customized to the different needs that sites have.

:doc:`base/frameworks/cluster </scripts/base/frameworks/cluster/index>`

   The cluster framework provides for establishing and controlling a cluster
   of Bro instances.

:doc:`base/frameworks/control </scripts/base/frameworks/control/index>`

   that can be taken remotely at runtime to modify a running Bro instance
   or collect information from the running instance.

   The NetControl framework provides a way for Bro to interact with networking
   hard- and software, e.g. for dropping and shunting IP addresses/connections,
   etc.

   The DPD (dynamic protocol detection) activates port-independent protocol
   detection and selectively disables analyzers if protocol violations occur.

:doc:`base/frameworks/signatures </scripts/base/frameworks/signatures/index>`

   The signature framework provides for doing low-level pattern matching.  While
   signatures are not Bro's preferred detection tool, they sometimes come in
   handy and are closer to what many people are familiar with from using
   other NIDS.

:doc:`base/frameworks/packet-filter </scripts/base/frameworks/packet-filter/index>`

   The packet filter framework supports how Bro sets its BPF capture filter.

:doc:`base/frameworks/software </scripts/base/frameworks/software/index>`

   is carried out by external protocol-specific scripts that feed into
   this framework.

:doc:`base/frameworks/intel </scripts/base/frameworks/intel/index>`

   The intelligence framework provides a way to store and query intelligence
   data (such as IP addresses or strings). Metadata can also be associated
   with the intelligence.

:doc:`base/frameworks/config </scripts/base/frameworks/config/index>`

   The configuration framework provides a way to change the Bro configuration
   in "option" values at run-time.

:doc:`base/frameworks/tunnels </scripts/base/frameworks/tunnels/index>`

   The tunnels framework handles the tracking/logging of tunnels (e.g. Teredo,
   AYIYA, or IP-in-IP such as 6to4 where "IP" is either IPv4 or IPv6).

   Support for the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP).
   
   Note that currently the IMAP analyzer only supports analyzing IMAP sessions
   until they do or do not switch to TLS using StartTLS. Hence, we do not get
   mails from IMAP sessions, only X509 certificates.

   wouldn't be detected at all.

:doc:`base/protocols/xmpp </scripts/base/protocols/xmpp/index>`

   Support for the Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP).

:doc:`policy/integration/collective-intel </scripts/policy/integration/collective-intel/index>`

   The scripts in this module are for deeper integration with the
   Collective Intelligence Framework (CIF) since Bro's Intel framework
   doesn't natively behave the same as CIF nor does it store and maintain
   the same data in all cases.

   Detect hosts that are running traceroute.

:doc:`policy/tuning </scripts/policy/tuning/index>`
