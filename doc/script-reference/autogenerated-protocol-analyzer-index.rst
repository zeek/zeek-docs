   is a low level event that should usually be avoided for user code. Use
   :zeek:see:`ConnThreshold::duration_threshold_crossed` instead.
   
   Note that this event is not raised at the exact moment that a duration threshold is crossed; instead
   it is raised when the next packet is seen after the threshold has been crossed. On a connection that is
   idle, this can be raised significantly later.

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (c: :zeek:type:`connection`, is_orig: :zeek:type:`bool`, application: :zeek:type:`count`, fc: :zeek:type:`count`, iin: :zeek:type:`count`)

   Generated for a DNP3 response header.
   

   :c: The connection the DNP3 communication is part of.
   

   :is_orig: True if this reflects originator-side activity.
   

   :fc: function code.
   

   :iin: internal indication number.
   

.. zeek:id:: dnp3_object_header

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (c: :zeek:type:`connection`, is_orig: :zeek:type:`bool`, obj_type: :zeek:type:`count`, qua_field: :zeek:type:`count`, number: :zeek:type:`count`, rf_low: :zeek:type:`count`, rf_high: :zeek:type:`count`)

   Generated for the object header found in both DNP3 requests and responses.
   

   :c: The connection the DNP3 communication is part of.
   

   :is_orig: True if this reflects originator-side activity.
   

   :obj_type: type of object, which is classified based on an 8-bit group number
             and an 8-bit variation number.
   

   :qua_field: qualifier field.
   

   :number: TODO.
   

   :rf_low: the structure of the range field depends on the qualified field.
           In some cases, the range field contains only one logic part, e.g.,
           number of objects, so only *rf_low* contains useful values.
   

   :rf_high: in some cases, the range field contains two logic parts, e.g., start
            index and stop index, so *rf_low* contains the start index
            while *rf_high* contains the stop index.
   

.. zeek:id:: dnp3_object_prefix

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (c: :zeek:type:`connection`, is_orig: :zeek:type:`bool`, prefix_value: :zeek:type:`count`)

   Generated for the prefix before a DNP3 object. The structure and the meaning
   of the prefix are defined by the qualifier field.
   

   :c: The connection the DNP3 communication is part of.
   

   :is_orig: True if this reflects originator-side activity.
   

   :prefix_value: The prefix.
   

.. zeek:id:: dnp3_header_block

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (c: :zeek:type:`connection`, is_orig: :zeek:type:`bool`, len: :zeek:type:`count`, ctrl: :zeek:type:`count`, dest_addr: :zeek:type:`count`, src_addr: :zeek:type:`count`)

   Generated for an additional header that the DNP3 analyzer passes to the
   script-level. This header mimics the DNP3 transport-layer yet is only passed
   once for each sequence of DNP3 records (which are otherwise reassembled and
   treated as a single entity).
   

   :c: The connection the DNP3 communication is part of.
   

   :is_orig: True if this reflects originator-side activity.
   

   :len:   the "length" field in the DNP3 Pseudo Link Layer.
   

   :ctrl:  the "control" field in the DNP3 Pseudo Link Layer.
   

   :dest_addr: the "destination" field in the DNP3 Pseudo Link Layer.
   

   :src_addr: the "source" field in the DNP3 Pseudo Link Layer.
   

.. zeek:id:: dnp3_response_data_object

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (c: :zeek:type:`connection`, is_orig: :zeek:type:`bool`, data_value: :zeek:type:`count`)

   Generated for a DNP3 "Response_Data_Object".
   The "Response_Data_Object" contains two parts: object prefix and object
   data. In most cases, object data are defined by new record types. But
   in a few cases, object data are directly basic types, such as int16, or
   int8; thus we use an additional *data_value* to record the values of those
   object data.
   

   :c: The connection the DNP3 communication is part of.
   

   :is_orig: True if this reflects originator-side activity.
   

   :data_value: The value for those objects that carry their information here
               directly.

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (c: :zeek:type:`connection`, is_orig: :zeek:type:`bool`, msg: :zeek:type:`dns_msg`, len: :zeek:type:`count`)

   Generated for all DNS messages.
   
   See `Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System>`__ for more
   information about the DNS protocol. Zeek analyzes both UDP and TCP DNS
   sessions.
   

   :c: The connection, which may be UDP or TCP depending on the type of the
      transport-layer session being analyzed.
   

   :is_orig:  True if the message was sent by the originator of the connection.
   

   :msg: The parsed DNS message header.
   

   :len: The length of the message's raw representation (i.e., the DNS payload).

   Generated for DNS requests. For requests with multiple queries, this event
   is raised once for each.
   
   See `Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System>`__ for more
   information about the DNS protocol. Zeek analyzes both UDP and TCP DNS
   sessions.

   Generated for DNS replies that reject a query. This event is raised if a DNS
   reply indicates failure because it does not pass on any
   answers to a query. Note that all of the event's parameters are parsed out of
   the reply; there's no stateful correlation with the query.

   potentially more than once if the body contains further nested MIME
   entities. Zeek raises this event just before it starts parsing each entity's

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (c: :zeek:type:`connection`, is_orig: :zeek:type:`bool`, length: :zeek:type:`count`, data: :zeek:type:`string`)

   Generated when parsing an HTTP body entity, passing on the data. This event
   can potentially be raised many times for each entity, each time passing a
   chunk of the data of not further defined size.
   
   A common idiom for using this event is to first *reassemble* the data
   at the scripting layer by concatenating it to a successively growing
   string; and only perform further content analysis once the corresponding
   :zeek:id:`http_end_entity` event has been raised. Note, however, that doing so
   can be quite expensive for HTTP tranders. At the very least, one should
   impose an upper size limit on how much data is being buffered.

   Generated for reporting an HTTP body's content type.  This event is
   generated at the end of parsing an HTTP header, passing on the MIME
   type as specified by the ``Content-Type`` header. If that header is
   missing, this event is still raised with a default value of ``text/plain``.

   Generated once at the end of parsing an HTTP message. Zeek supports persistent
   and pipelined HTTP sessions and raises corresponding events as it parses
   client/server dialogues. A "message" is one top-level HTTP entity, such as a
   complete request or reply. Each message can have further nested sub-entities
   inside. This event is raised once all sub-entities belonging to a top-level
   message have been processed (and their corresponding ``http_entity_*`` events
   generated).

   .. zeek:see:: skip_smtp_data

.. zeek:id:: unescape_URI

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (URI: :zeek:type:`string`) : :zeek:type:`string`

   Unescapes all characters in a URI (decode every ``%xx`` group).
   

   :URI: The URI to unescape.
   

   :returns: The unescaped URI with all ``%xx`` groups decoded.
   
   .. note::
   
        Unescaping reserved characters may cause loss of information.
        :rfc:`2396`: A URI is always in an "escaped" form, since escaping or
        unescaping a completed URI might change its semantics.  Normally, the
        only time escape encodings can safely be made is when the URI is
        being created from its component parts.

.. zeek:id:: get_login_state

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (cid: :zeek:type:`conn_id`) : :zeek:type:`count`

   Returns the state of the given login (Telnet or Rlogin) connection.
   

   :cid: The connection ID.
   

   :returns: False if the connection is not active or is not tagged as a
            login analyzer. Otherwise the function returns the state, which can
            be one of:
   
                - ``LOGIN_STATE_AUTHENTICATE``: The connection is in its
                  initial authentication dialog.
                - ``LOGIN_STATE_LOGGED_IN``: The analyzer believes the user has
                  successfully authenticated.
                - ``LOGIN_STATE_SKIP``: The analyzer has skipped any further
                  processing of the connection.
                - ``LOGIN_STATE_CONFUSED``: The analyzer has concluded that it
                  does not correctly know the state of the connection, and/or
                  the username associated with it.

.. zeek:id:: mime_begin_entity

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (c: :zeek:type:`connection`)

   Generated when starting to parse an email MIME entity. MIME is a
   protocol-independent data format for encoding text and files, along with
   corresponding metadata, for transmission. Zeek raises this event when it
   begins parsing a MIME entity extracted from an email protocol.

.. zeek:id:: mime_segment_data

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (c: :zeek:type:`connection`, length: :zeek:type:`count`, data: :zeek:type:`string`)

   Generated for chunks of decoded MIME data from email MIME entities.  MIME
   is a protocol-independent data format for encoding text and files, along with
   corresponding metadata, for transmission. As Zeek parses the data of an
   entity, it raises a sequence of these events, each coming as soon as a new
   chunk of data is available. In contrast, there is also
   :zeek:id:`mime_entity_data`, which passes all of an entities data at once
   in a single block. While the latter is more convenient to handle,
   ``mime_segment_data`` is more efficient as Zeek does not need to buffer
   the data. Thus, if possible, this event should be preferred.

   the complete content of a single MIME entity with the quoted-printable and
   and base64 data decoded. In contrast, there is also :zeek:id:`mime_segment_data`,
   which passes on a sequence of data chunks as they come in. While

   See `Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol>`__
   for more information about the SMTP protocol.
   

   :c: The connection.
   

   :is_orig: True if the sender of the command is the originator of the TCP
         connection. Note that this is not redundant: the SMTP ``TURN`` command
         allows client and server to flip roles on established SMTP sessions,
         and hence a "request" might still come from the TCP-level responder.
         In practice, however, that will rarely happen as TURN is considered
         insecure and rarely used.

.. zeek:id:: ssh_auth_successful

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (c: :zeek:type:`connection`, auth_method_none: :zeek:type:`bool`)

   This event is generated when an :abbr:`SSH (Secure Shell)`
   connection was determined to have had a successful
   authentication. This determination is based on packet size
   analysis, and errs on the side of caution - that is, if there's any
   doubt about the authentication success, this event is *not* raised.
   

   :c: The connection over which the :abbr:`SSH (Secure Shell)`
      connection took place.
   

   :auth_method_none: This is true if the analyzer detected a
      successful connection before any authentication challenge. The
      :abbr:`SSH (Secure Shell)` protocol provides a mechanism for
      unauthenticated access, which some servers support.

.. zeek:id:: ssh_auth_attempted

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (c: :zeek:type:`connection`, authenticated: :zeek:type:`bool`)

   This event is generated when an :abbr:`SSH (Secure Shell)`
   connection was determined to have had an authentication attempt.
   This determination is based on packet size analysis, and errs
   on the side of caution - that is, if there's any doubt about
   whether or not an authenication attempt occured, this event is
   *not* raised.
   
   At this point in the protocol, all we can determine is whether
   or not the user is authenticated. We don't know if the particular
   attempt succeeded or failed, since some servers require multiple
   authentications (e.g. require both a password AND a pubkey), and
   could return an authentication failed message which is marked
   as a partial success.
   
   This event will often be raised multiple times per connection.
   In almost all connections, it will be raised once unless

   :possible_ts: The current time as sent by the server. Note that SSL/TLS does
                not require clocks to be set correctly, so treat with care. This value
                is meaningless in SSLv2 and TLSv1.3.
   

   :session_id: The session ID as sent back by the server (if any). This value is not
               sent in TLSv1.3.
   

   :server_random: The random value sent by the server. For version 2 connections,
   		  the connection-id is returned. Note - the full 32 bytes are included in
   		  server_random. This means that the 4 bytes present in possible_ts are repeated;
   		  if you do not want this behavior ignore the first 4 bytes.
   

   :cipher: The cipher chosen by the server.  The values are standardized as part
           of the SSL/TLS protocol. The :zeek:id:`SSL::cipher_desc` table maps
           them to descriptive names.
   

   :comp_method: The compression method chosen by the client. The values are
                standardized as part of the SSL/TLS protocol. This value is not
                sent in TLSv1.3 or SSLv2.

   Generated for an unsuccessful connection attempt. This event is raised when
   an originator unsuccessfully attempted to establish a connection.
   "Unsuccessful" is defined as at least :zeek:id:`tcp_attempt_delay` seconds

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (c: :zeek:type:`connection`)

   Generated when seeing a SYN-ACK packet from the responder in a TCP
   handshake.  An associated SYN packet was not seen from the originator
   side if its state is not set to :zeek:see:`TCP_ESTABLISHED`.
   The final ACK of the handshake in response to SYN-ACK may
   or may not occur later, one way to tell is to check the *history* field of
   :zeek:type:`connection` to see if the originator sent an ACK, indicated by
   'A' in the history string.

   Generated when a previously inactive endpoint attempts to close a TCP
   connection via a normal FIN handshake or an abort RST sequence. When the
   endpoint sent one of these packets, Zeek waits
   :zeek:id:`tcp_partial_close_delay` prior to generating the event, to give
   the other endpoint a chance to close the connection normally.

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (c: :zeek:type:`connection`)

      and then :zeek:id:`connection_reset`.

.. zeek:id:: connection_reset

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (c: :zeek:type:`connection`)

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (c: :zeek:type:`connection`, pkt: :zeek:type:`SYN_packet`)

   Generated for a SYN packet. Zeek raises this event for every SYN packet seen
   by its TCP analyzer.
   

   :c: The connection.
   

   :pkt: Information extracted from the SYN packet.

   .. note::
   
      This event has quite low-level semantics and can potentially be expensive
      to generate. It should only be used if one really needs the specific
      information passed into the handler via the ``pkt`` argument. If not,
      handling one of the other ``connection_*`` events is typically the
      better approach.

.. zeek:id:: connection_first_ACK

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (c: :zeek:type:`connection`, is_orig: :zeek:type:`bool`)

   Generated at the end of reassembled TCP connections. The TCP reassembler
   raised the event once for each endpoint of a connection when it finished
   reassembling the corresponding side of the communication.
   

   :c: The connection.

   Generated for every TCP packet. This is a very low-level and expensive event
   that should be avoided when at all possible. It's usually infeasible to
   handle when processing even medium volumes of traffic in real-time.  It's
   slightly better than :zeek:id:`new_packet` because it affects only TCP, but
   not much. That said, if you work from a trace and want to do some
   packet-level analysis, it may come in handy.
   

   :c: The connection the packet is part of.
   

   :is_orig: True if the packet was sent by the connection's originator.
   

   :flags: A string with the packet's TCP flags. In the string, each character
          corresponds to one set flag, as follows: ``S`` -> SYN; ``F`` -> FIN;
          ``R`` -> RST; ``A`` -> ACK; ``P`` -> PUSH.
   

   :seq: The packet's relative TCP sequence number.
   

   :ack: If the ACK flag is set for the packet, the packet's relative ACK
        number, else zero.
   

   :len: The length of the TCP payload, as specified in the packet header.
   

   :payload: The raw TCP payload. Note that this may be shorter than *len* if
            the packet was not fully captured.

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (c: :zeek:type:`connection`, is_orig: :zeek:type:`bool`, opt: :zeek:type:`count`, optlen: :zeek:type:`count`)

   Generated for each option found in a TCP header. Like many of the ``tcp_*``
   events, this is a very low-level event and potentially expensive as it may
   be raised very often.
   

   :c: The connection the packet is part of.
   

   :is_orig: True if the packet was sent by the connection's originator.
   

   :opt: The numerical option number, as found in the TCP header.

   :Type: :zeek:type:`event` (c: :zeek:type:`connection`, is_orig: :zeek:type:`bool`, seq: :zeek:type:`count`, contents: :zeek:type:`string`)

   Generated for each chunk of reassembled TCP payload. When content delivery is
   enabled for a TCP connection (via :zeek:id:`tcp_content_delivery_ports_orig`,
   :zeek:id:`tcp_content_delivery_ports_resp`,
   :zeek:id:`tcp_content_deliver_all_orig`,
   :zeek:id:`tcp_content_deliver_all_resp`), this event is raised for each chunk
   of in-order payload reconstructed from the packet stream. Note that this
   event is potentially expensive if many connections carry significant amounts
   of data as then all that data needs to be passed on to the scripting layer.
   

   :c: The connection the payload is part of.
   

   :is_orig: True if the packet was sent by the connection's originator.
   

   :seq: The sequence number corresponding to the first byte of the payload
        chunk.
   

   :contents: The raw payload, which will be non-empty.

   .. note::
   
      The payload received by this event is the same that is also passed into
      application-layer protocol analyzers internally. Subsequent invocations of
      this event for the same connection receive non-overlapping in-order chunks
      of its TCP payload stream. It is however undefined what size each chunk
      has; while Zeek passes the data on as soon as possible, specifics depend on
      network-level effects such as latency, acknowledgements, reordering, etc.

   Generated for each detected TCP segment retransmission.
   

   :c: The connection the packet is part of.
   

   :is_orig: True if the packet was sent by the connection's originator.
   

   :seq: The segment's relative TCP sequence number.

Functions
+++++++++

.. zeek:id:: get_orig_seq

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (cid: :zeek:type:`conn_id`) : :zeek:type:`count`

   Get the originator sequence number of a TCP connection. Sequence numbers
   are absolute (i.e., they reflect the values seen directly in packet headers;
   they are not relative to the beginning of the connection).
   

   :cid: The connection ID.
   

   :returns: The highest sequence number sent by a connection's originator, or 0
            if *cid* does not point to an active TCP connection.
   
   .. zeek:see:: get_resp_seq

.. zeek:id:: get_resp_seq

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (cid: :zeek:type:`conn_id`) : :zeek:type:`count`

   Get the responder sequence number of a TCP connection. Sequence numbers
   are absolute (i.e., they reflect the values seen directly in packet headers;
   they are not relative to the beginning of the connection).
   

   :cid: The connection ID.
   

   :returns: The highest sequence number sent by a connection's responder, or 0
            if *cid* does not point to an active TCP connection.
   
   .. zeek:see:: get_orig_seq

.. zeek:id:: set_contents_file

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (cid: :zeek:type:`conn_id`, direction: :zeek:type:`count`, f: :zeek:type:`file`) : :zeek:type:`bool`

   Associates a file handle with a connection for writing TCP byte stream
   contents.
   

   :cid: The connection ID.
   

   :direction: Controls what sides of the connection to record. The argument can
              take one of the four values:
   
              - ``CONTENTS_NONE``: Stop recording the connection's content.
              - ``CONTENTS_ORIG``: Record the data sent by the connection
                originator (often the client).
              - ``CONTENTS_RESP``: Record the data sent by the connection
                responder (often the server).
              - ``CONTENTS_BOTH``: Record the data sent in both directions.
                Results in the two directions being intermixed in the file,
                in the order the data was seen by Zeek.
   

   :f: The file handle of the file to write the contents to.
   

   :returns: Returns false if *cid* does not point to an active connection, and
            true otherwise.
   
   .. note::
   
       The data recorded to the file reflects the byte stream, not the
       contents of individual packets. Reordering and duplicates are
       removed. If any data is missing, the recording stops at the
       missing data; this can happen, e.g., due to an
       :zeek:id:`content_gap` event.
   
   .. zeek:see:: get_contents_file set_record_packets contents_file_write_failure

.. zeek:id:: get_contents_file

   :Type: :zeek:type:`function` (cid: :zeek:type:`conn_id`, direction: :zeek:type:`count`) : :zeek:type:`file`

   Returns the file handle of the contents file of a connection.
   

   :cid: The connection ID.
   

   :direction: Controls what sides of the connection to record. See
              :zeek:id:`set_contents_file` for possible values.
   

   :returns: The :zeek:type:`file` handle for the contents file of the
            connection identified by *cid*. If the connection exists
            but there is no contents file for *direction*, then the function
            generates an error and returns a file handle to ``stderr``.

   for all UDP request and reply packets by setting
   :zeek:id:`udp_content_deliver_all_orig` or
   :zeek:id:`udp_content_deliver_all_resp`, respectively. Note that this
   event is also raised for all matching UDP packets, including empty ones.
