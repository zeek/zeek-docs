# WARNING: New redirects cannot be added, since RTD introduced a cap of 100
# redirects. You can, however, manually edit and remove redirects in the UI.
# When doing so, modify this file as well for documentation.
#
# These are all the Page Redirects required for RTD project at docs.zeek.org.
# A nice thing about RTD redirects is that they are only utilized if a page
# 404s, so redirects can be added as soon as a broken link needs to be fixed in
# latest/master and it won't automatically try to redirect the still-working
# page in stable/release.
#
# RTD doesn't have an official API to add all the redirects defined here, but
# this tool uses its HTML interface:
#
#     https://github.com/honzajavorek/rtd-redirects

redirects:
  # "Book of Zeek" revisions.
