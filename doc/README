Documentation
=============

This directory contains documentation in reStructuredText format
(see http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html).

It is the root of a Sphinx source tree and can be modified to add more
documentation, style sheets, JavaScript, etc.  The Sphinx config file
is ``conf.py``.

There is also a custom Sphinx domain implemented in ``ext/zeek.py``
which adds some reST directives and roles that aid in generating useful
index entries and cross-references.  Other extensions can be added in
a similar fashion.

The ``make doc`` target in the top-level Makefile can be used to locally
render the reST files into HTML.  That target depends on:

* Python interpreter >= 2.7
* Sphinx: http://sphinx-doc.org
* Read the Docs Sphinx Theme: https://github.com/rtfd/sphinx_rtd_theme
* GitPython: https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython

If you have pip, you may just use ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` to
install all the dependencies.

After the build completes, HTML documentation is symlinked in ``build/html``.

There's also a ``make livehtml`` target in the top-level Makefile that
is useful for editing the reST files and seeing changes rendered out live
to a separate HTML browser.
